Milestone for us - Demo on May which includes: Admin functionality to be able to create a new clinician, deactivate account, creds etc This functionality is needed for the RFP that Trayt has applied for with a big hospital. The demo will help to showcase what Trayt offers and get the deal The other is a leadership dashboard where a hospital's leader can see how different clinics within their hospitals are doing in regards to the comorbidity assessments or tryats intake form completed and clinician engagement in the portal. (Mockups is in progress) These features will be for the demo purpose and not going to production Problem/Solution statement example: If a patient has inability to focus, the first thing the clinician will do is Vanderbild ADHD assessment. But if we look deeper into the cluster of symptoms data for the patient, the reason for not able to focus could be associated with depression or abdominal pain. So, Trayt helps to identify where the first line of treatment needs be be before jumping to the assessment right</p>",
